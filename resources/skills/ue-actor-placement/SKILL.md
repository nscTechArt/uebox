# Actor placement and scene edits

Verified against UE 5.5.4 with UnrealAgentLink: spawn → query → inspect → set property →
bulk transform → delete, checked by reading the scene back rather than trusting the return value.

## Units: every length is centimetres

**1 metre = 100.** A 13 m building is `1300`. Two props 20 m apart differ by `2000`.
This applies to `location`, to `bounds`, and to anything else that is a length.
`scale` is a multiplier and `rotation` is degrees — neither converts.

Any number that came from Blender, a reference image, a floor plan, or your own reasoning
about how big something should be is **in metres, and must be multiplied by 100** before it
goes into a tool. Nothing enforces this. Skip the step and every tool still returns
`success` — the scene is just 100× too small, piled up near the origin.

This has actually happened: 23 assets, 72 actors, a whole reference scene laid out in metres
and fed straight in. Several rounds of "verification" passed because the check being run was
*"does what I read back match what I wrote?"* It did. **Self-consistency cannot detect a unit
error** — both sides are wrong in exactly the same way. Only an external reference catches it.

So use one:

1. **Before laying anything out**, spawn a `cube` preset at the origin with default scale.
   It is exactly 100 cm on each side. Read it back with `return_bounds: true` and confirm the
   bounds come back as `100 × 100 × 100`. That pins the unit for the rest of the session.
2. **After a bulk placement**, read the message tail. `ue_spawn_actor`, `ue_set_transform` and
   `ue_get_actor` all report the placement span **converted to metres**. Compare it against the
   scene you meant to build. A city block that spans 0.4 m is not a rounding error.
3. If the span is two orders of magnitude off, it is metres-vs-centimetres. Fix it in one call —
   `{ filter: {} }` with `operation: { multiply: { location: { x: 100, y: 100, z: 100 } } }` —
   rather than nudging actors one at a time.

## When the user says it looks wrong

Believe them, and suspect the coordinate system first. The user is looking at the viewport;
you are looking at numbers that are internally consistent. When those two disagree, the numbers
are the weaker evidence — they cannot distinguish a correct layout from one that is uniformly
100× off.

Do not answer a visual report with a data argument. "The transforms read back correctly" is
not a rebuttal to "everything is tiny and stacked up" — both can be true at once, and when they
are, the unit convention is the thing that is wrong. Check the span in metres, or ask the user
for a screenshot, before offering any other theory.

Do not rely on `ue_screenshot` alone to settle this either. Check its `camera_source` field
first: `fallback` means it could not find the editor viewport and used an arbitrary camera, so
the framing proves nothing about what is or is not in the scene. Aim with `ue_focus_viewport`
and shoot again, or ask the user to send their own screenshot.

## The selector is the whole game

Every tool except `ue_spawn_actor` takes a `targets` selector. Four forms:

```
{ selection: true }                        whatever the user has selected right now
{ names:  ["MyCube", "MySphere"] }        exact actor labels
{ paths:  ["/Game/.../PersistentLevel.X"] }
{ filter: { class: "PointLight" } }        also: name_pattern, exclude_classes
```

**`selection: true` is the answer to every demonstrative.** "这个"、"我选中的那个"、
"this one" — the user is pointing at the viewport or the World Outliner (they are the same
selection set). Do not write Python against `EditorActorSubsystem` to read it, and do not try
to work out which actor they meant from context: pass `selection: true` and the engine tells
you. If nothing is selected you get `count: 0` with a message saying so — ask the user to
select something rather than falling back to a guess.

It combines with the other forms; `{ selection: true, names: ["Floor"] }` is the union.

**Match on the label, not the internal object name.** The label is what the World Outliner
shows and what every tool reports back. An actor spawned as `UACube` may live at
`…PersistentLevel.UACube_1` — feeding that internal name into a selector finds nothing.

When you are unsure of exact labels, use `filter.name_pattern` (`"UA*"`) rather than guessing
`names`. It is the difference between a working call and a 404.

**Names that matched nothing come back in `unmatched_targets`.** Pass seven names, six exist:
the call still succeeds, operates on six, and lists the seventh with a ⚠️ in the message. That
is not a soft warning to skim past — on `ue_destroy_actor` it means one actor you meant to
delete is still there, and on `ue_focus_viewport` it means the screenshot you are about to
take is missing something. Read the line back to the user rather than reporting "done".

## Spawn

`ue_spawn_actor` has **no required fields** in its schema but rejects an empty call. Supply
either a single actor (`class` + `name` + optionally `mesh`, `location`, `rotation`, `scale`)
or several at once via `instances`. One call with an `instances` array is a single round-trip —
use it for more than one actor rather than looping.

**50 instances per call, maximum.** That is the engine-side cap (`ual.MaxBatchCreate`) and
going over it rejects the *whole* batch, not just the extras. Laying out 200 props is four
calls of 50, not one call of 200.

## Modular kits: read the pivot before you compute a single coordinate

> For a **row** of objects — a street, a fence, a shelf — skip this arithmetic entirely and use
> `ue_set_transform`'s `arrange` operation (see "Laying out a row" below). It works off measured
> bounding boxes, so the pivot cannot trip it up. The rest of this section is for single objects
> and for "this one edge must sit at this coordinate".

A floor, four walls and a ceiling only line up if you know **where each mesh's origin sits
relative to its geometry**. That convention is not uniform, not even inside one asset pack:
floors are often pivoted at a corner and extend towards +X/+Y, while walls and ceilings are
centred. Assume "centred" for all of them and you get a ceiling hovering outside the walls
and a door lying flat on the ground — which is exactly what happened on a real run that then
spent eight extra round-trips reverse-engineering the truth.

Two places give it to you, both read-only:

- **Before spawning** — `mesh_describe` on the asset prints an 原点 line: which axes are
  centred, which are flush against an end, and the two corner points in asset space. The
  `location` you pass to `ue_spawn_actor` lands the *origin*, so a mesh flush at -Z sits on
  the floor at `z: 0` while a centred one needs `z: height / 2`.
- **After spawning** — `ue_get_actor` with `return_bounds: true` adds `bounds_min`,
  `bounds_max` and `pivot_offset` (= location − bounds_min) in world space.

**Do not use `ue_focus_viewport` to work this out.** It flies the user's camera, changes their
selection, and only reports the union box of everything you passed it — three side effects for
a number two read-only tools already hand you.

Give `mesh` a real asset path (`/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube`) when the user wants to see
something. A `StaticMeshActor` with no mesh assigned is invisible, and later material
operations will silently skip it.

## Reading the scene back

`ue_get_actor` with `return_transform: true` gives you positions. **A query that matches nothing
returns `count: 0`, not an error** — so it is safe to use as an existence check before acting.

Do this after any bulk change. `ue_set_transform` reporting success does not prove the actors
moved; read the transforms back and confirm the numbers changed as intended.

`return_bounds: true` gives the **full** world-space size (length × width × height, in
centimetres) — not a half-extent, not a pair of corner points. Doubling it to "get the full
size" produces an object twice as big as the real one. It already includes the actor's scale
and rotation.

For a Blueprint instance, the reported `class` (`BP_Door_C`) is a class name, not an asset
path. The same result carries `blueprint_path` (`/Game/PartyMVP/Props/BP_Door`) — hand that
straight to `blueprint_describe`. Searching the content browser for something that looks like
the class name costs two extra round-trips and lands on the wrong asset when the name repeats.

## Transforms

`ue_set_transform` takes `targets` plus an `operation`. Its two parameters are typed as "any"
in the schema, so the shapes only exist in the tool description — read it before calling.

```
{ set:      { location: { z: 200 } } }     absolute — 200 cm = 2 m
{ add:      { location: { z: 50 } } }      relative (0.5 m), negatives allowed
{ multiply: { scale: { x: 2, y: 2, z: 2 } } }        multiplier, not a length
{ multiply: { location: { x: 100, y: 100, z: 100 } } } the metres→cm rescue
{ space: "Local", add: { ... } }           default space is World
{ snap_to_floor: true }                    on the operation itself, never inside `set`
{ arrange: { axis, gap, start?, align? } } lay a set out along one axis, no overlap
```

### Laying out a row — do not compute the spacing yourself

`arrange` is the operation for "put these N things in a line": a street of houses, a fence, a
shelf of props.

```
{ arrange: { axis: "y", gap: 200, start: -800,
             align: { axis: "x", edge: "min", value: -1310 } } }
```

`gap` is **edge to edge on the real bounding box**, so objects of different sizes never overlap
and never leave a gap you did not ask for. `align` pins each object's `min`/`max`/`center` to a
line on a second axis — that is how you get a row flush against a road or a wall. Without
`start` the row is laid out in place, beginning at the current front-most edge. With
`targets.names` the order you wrote is the order on the ground.

**This replaces the pivot arithmetic in the section above for rows.** Computing `x += width +
gap` from `mesh_describe` is where placement actually goes wrong: the origin sits in a different
spot on every asset, so the arithmetic is right for half your kit and silently wrong for the
other half. `arrange` never touches the origin — it pushes each object's measured `min` edge to
a cursor — so that whole class of failure does not exist. Read the pivot section for single
objects and for "this edge must sit at this coordinate" cases; use `arrange` for rows.

Limits worth knowing before you call it: 100 actors per call, mutually exclusive with
`set`/`add`/`multiply`/`snap_to_floor` (arrange first, then snap in a second call), and it
refuses rather than half-doing the job — an unresolved name, or a mix of `names` with
`filter`/`paths`, comes back as an error naming what it could not place. If a move fails
part-way it says how many already moved and gives you the `start` to pass on the retry.

Undo is **one entry per actor**, not one per call, because each actor is moved by its own
command. Arranging 20 buildings puts 20 entries on the stack — `ue_undo` with `steps: 1` will
put back exactly one of them.

### Putting something on the ground

`snap_to_floor` traces straight down from the bottom of the actor's bounds and lands that
bottom on the first surface it hits (`WorldStatic` first, then `Visibility`). It can be the
only field in the operation, or ride along with `set`/`add`.

Two things to know, both of which cost real round-trips on a real machine:

- **Writing it inside `set` is rejected** (400). It belongs on the operation.
- **A miss leaves the actor exactly where it was**, and the readback says so out loud
  (`⚠️ 贴地：… 位置没有变`). That happens when the ground mesh has no collision. Do not
  read a plain success as "it is on the floor" — read the snap line.

**The top of a bounding box is not the walkable surface.** A road mesh whose bounds top is
`+36` can still be walked on at `z≈0`; the difference is geometry above the road surface
(kerbs, signage) inflating the box. Deducing ground height from `bounds_max.z` floats
characters in the air. Prefer `snap_to_floor`; if it misses, read `bounds_min.z` of a prop
that is visibly already resting on the ground (a barrel, a lamp post) and use that.

One operation applies to every actor the selector matched, which is what makes "raise all the
lights by 50" a single call. It also means a sloppy selector changes more than intended —
run `ue_get_actor` with the same selector first and tell the user the count before mutating.

## Rotation: do not compute pitch signs in your head

UE rotation is `{ pitch, yaw, roll }` in degrees. Local **+X is the "front"**; lights,
cameras and scene captures all shoot along +X. The conventions that get people:

- **pitch: positive is nose-up.** A directional light that should shine *down* needs a
  **negative** pitch: dusk `-5…-15`, noon `-60…-90`. `pitch: +30` lights the scene from
  underground and the whole frame goes grey.
- **yaw:** 0 faces +X, 90 faces +Y, 180 faces -X, -90 faces -Y.
- **roll:** positive tilts right. It means nothing on a directional light — leave it 0.
  A plane or fog card uses `roll: ±90` to stand upright.

This has actually happened: a sun set to `(pitch 30, yaw 180, roll -135)`, several rounds of
"the scene looks washed out" spent adjusting fog and exposure, and the user pointing out the
light was aimed upwards. Nothing rejected it; every call returned `success`.

So don't derive the rotator yourself — say what you mean and let the tool convert:

```
{ set: { sun: { elevation: 8, azimuth: 300 } } }   directional light: how high the sun is
                                                   (0 horizon … 90 overhead) and which way it
                                                   sits (0 = +X, 90 = +Y). Mutually exclusive
                                                   with set.rotation.
{ set: { face_direction: { x: -1, y: 0, z: 0 } } } point +X along a world vector, roll = 0.
                                                   "Face the camera" = camera - self.
```

Then **read the orientation line**. `ue_set_transform`, `ue_spawn_actor` and `ue_get_actor`
translate the rotation the engine reports back into words: *"方向光：太阳高度角 8°（黄昏），光往
+X 偏 -Y 30° 照下来"*, or *"正面(+X)朝 -X 方向，水平；顶面(+Z)朝 -Y（竖立着）"* for a fog card.
A directional light aimed upwards is flagged with ⚠️ in that line. It is computed from what
the engine has, not from what you sent, so it is the one check that cannot agree with your
own mistake. `ue_focus_viewport` and `ue_screenshot` say the same thing about the camera —
"仰视 34°" next to a frame full of sky means the camera drifted, not that the scene is gone.

## Which way does a character's face point?

An actor's rotation tells you where the actor's **+X** points. It does not tell you where the
**mesh's face** points — a skeletal mesh can be authored facing +X, +Y or anything else, and
that offset is why a character walks sideways ("crab walk") while every number you read looks
correct. Screenshots are a bad check here: the viewport shows a T-pose, the game shows an
animated pose, and at any distance the face is a few grey pixels.

Ask instead. `mesh_describe` on a skeletal mesh reports a facing line derived from the
reference skeleton's left/right bone pair:

> 朝向：正面偏离网格 +X 轴 -90.0°（依据 foot_l / foot_r 两根骨骼）

Then `actor yaw = the direction you want it to travel − that offset`. Walking along +X with a
`-90` offset means `yaw = 90`. When the rig uses unrecognised bone names the line says so
outright — only then fall back to a front-on playtest frame.

Put that compensation on the **actor's rotation**, and keep it as an editable variable rather
than a literal, so "it's backwards" is a one-value fix instead of a rebuild.

Do **not** try to fix facing with `SetRelativeRotation` on the **root** component.
`AActor::SetActorRotation` is implemented as `RootComponent->MoveComponent(...)` — the actor's
rotation *is* the root component's world rotation, one storage slot. Anything that also drives
the actor's rotation (your walk logic, a movement component, `SetActorRotation` on a timer)
overwrites your compensation, and the graph still reads as correctly wired and compiles clean.
A non-root mesh component is a different slot and does work, but there is no read-back for
component transforms at runtime, so you would be flying blind — use the actor rotation.

## Deleting

`ue_destroy_actor` is irreversible and will prompt the user for approval. It takes the same
selector as `ue_get_actor`, so one call deletes everything the selector matched. Name what will be deleted, by label and count, before calling — "delete 3 actors:
UACube, UASphere, UALight" is reviewable; "delete matching actors" is not.

After deleting, confirm with `ue_get_actor` on the same selector — an empty result is now a
normal success, so it is a clean way to prove the scene is in the state you claimed.
