Use when the user mentions Substrate or Strata, wants layered or physically combined materials, or says things like "用 Substrate 做个车漆"、"做一个 Substrate 材质"、"彩色玻璃"、"清漆层"、"湿润层 / 灰尘层叠上去"、"丝绒布料"、"肥皂泡 / 油膜彩虹色"、"Front Material 怎么接"、"开启 Substrate"、"这个 Substrate 材质编译不过". Do not use for ordinary PBR materials in a project that has Substrate off, for material instances and parameters, for Blueprint graphs, or for importing textures.

# Substrate materials

Everything below is checked against engine source for UE 5.4 to 5.8 and was run in a
live 5.8 editor through these tools. Node pin names come from the engine, so still call
`material_search_nodes` before writing a graph; the tables in `references/` are for
planning.

## The model in one paragraph

A Substrate material is built from **Slabs**, where each Slab is one physically described
layer (surface reflection plus what is underneath). **Operators** combine Slabs: side by
side through a mask, stacked as a coat, or faded by coverage. The finished tree plugs into
**one** input on the material output, `FrontMaterial`. Once `FrontMaterial` is wired,
the classic output pins (BaseColor, Metallic, Roughness, Normal, Emissive, ...) stop
counting.

## Quick start

```
1. material_search_nodes  query "Substrate"   → are nodes available? pins and properties
2. material_create                             → master material
3. material_set_property  (only if not Opaque) → blend mode, see the table below
4. material_apply_graph   nodes + connections  → last wire goes to Material.FrontMaterial
5. read the compile result in its reply, then ue_save
```

Minimal graph (a blue dielectric):

```
nodes: [
  { id: "albedo", node_type: "Constant3Vector", value: { r: 0.1, g: 0.3, b: 0.8 } },
  { id: "slab",   node_type: "SubstrateSlabBSDF" }
]
connections: [
  { from: "albedo.RGB", to: "slab.Diffuse Albedo" },
  { from: "slab.Out",   to: "Material.FrontMaterial" }
]
```

Pin names contain spaces (`Diffuse Albedo`, `Top Thickness`); write them as the search
result prints them. Every Substrate BSDF and operator has one output, `Out`.

Node **settings** that are not pins, such as the Slab's `SubSurfaceType` or an
operator's `bUseParameterBlending`, go in the node's `properties` in
`material_apply_graph`, or through `material_set_node_value` for a node that already
exists. `material_search_nodes` lists every setting with its default, and the reply
reports the value the engine actually stored.

## Step 1 decides everything: is Substrate on?

`material_search_nodes` with query "Substrate" answers it:

- **Nodes listed and no warning at the top** means Substrate is on. Continue.
- **A warning line saying Substrate is not enabled** means the project runs the classic
  renderer, and every Substrate node or `FrontMaterial` link will be refused. Do not
  work around it. Tell the user what switching costs: an editor restart, a recompile of
  every shader in the project, and existing materials change how they are handled. Ask
  them. If they agree:
  `ue_set_config` with config Engine, section `/Script/Engine.RendererSettings`, key
  `r.Substrate`, value `True`, then `ue_restart_editor`. It is read only at startup, so
  nothing changes until the restart.
- **A warning saying the engine is older than 5.4** means Substrate cannot be used. Build
  the look with the classic pins and say which part of the request that loses.

When the user only wants a plain PBR material in a Substrate project on **5.6 or later**,
the classic pins still work: the engine converts them behind the scenes. Use Substrate
nodes when the look needs layers, coats, fuzz, thin film or colored transmission, or when
the project is 5.4/5.5 (there the classic pins are unsupported once Substrate is on).
Version details: **`references/versions.md`**.

## Pick the building block

| the user wants | build | recipe |
|---|---|---|
| plain surface, metal or dielectric | `SubstrateSlabBSDF` (+ `SubstrateMetalnessToDiffuseAlbedoF0` for a metalness workflow) | R1 |
| car paint, lacquer | `SubstrateSimpleClearCoatBSDF`, or two Slabs in `SubstrateVerticalLayering` | R2 |
| skin, wax, jade | Slab with SSS (`SubsurfaceProfile` or `SSS MFP`), Opaque only | R3 |
| velvet, cloth sheen | Slab `Fuzz Amount` / `Fuzz Color` | R4 |
| colored glass, liquid | Slab + `SubstrateTransmittanceToMFP`, `SubSurfaceType=MSS_SimpleVolume` (5.6+), `SubstrateWeight`, blend `TranslucentColoredTransmittance` | R5 |
| soap bubble, oil slick | `SubstrateThinFilm` into the Slab's `F0` / `F90` | R6 |
| two materials by a mask | `SubstrateHorizontalMixing` | R7 |
| wet / dust / snow coat | `SubstrateVerticalLayering`, top coat faded by `SubstrateWeight` | R8 |
| glowing, unlit | `SubstrateUnlitBSDF` or Slab `Emissive Color` | R9 |
| water, hair, eye | the dedicated BSDF, alone at the root | R10-R12 |
| UI, post process, light function, decal, fog volume | the dedicated node, plugged straight into `FrontMaterial` | R13 |

settings: **`references/nodes.md`**.

## Rules the engine enforces

- **`FrontMaterial` takes Substrate data only.** A color or number wired into it is
  refused. Put a BSDF in between.
- **With `FrontMaterial` wired, the classic output pins are ignored**, and connecting to
  them is refused. Pins that still count: `WorldPositionOffset`, `AmbientOcclusion`,
  `OpacityMask` (Masked), `Refraction` (translucent with distortion), `PixelDepthOffset`,
  `Displacement` (tessellation). `material_get_graph` lists only the pins in effect and
  flags leftover wires as not taking effect.
- **Opacity is coverage.** Fade a BSDF with `SubstrateWeight` (`A` = the BSDF,
  `Weight` = 0 transparent … 1 solid). The output's `Opacity` pin only matters in
  AlphaComposite.
- **Subsurface scattering needs Opaque or Masked.** On a translucent material the engine
  forces the blend mode back to Opaque.
- **One BSDF output feeds one place.** Wiring the same Slab's `Out` into two operators
  fails to compile. Add a second Slab.
- **At most 15 operators and BSDFs in total, and at most 4 distinct normal/tangent
  inputs.** Share one normal source between Slabs.
- **The material domain follows the graph.** A `SubstrateUI`, `SubstratePostProcess`,
  `SubstrateLightFunction`, `SubstrateConvertToDecal` or `SubstrateVolumetricFogCloudBSDF`
  at the root sets the domain. A Slab at the root of a UI material turns it back into a
  surface material.
- **One material represents one kind of BSDF.** Do not mix Hair, Eye or water with Slabs.
  In 5.8, Horizontal, Vertical and Add accept only Slabs; earlier versions accept others
  but still render them wrong.

## Blend modes

| look | blend_mode |
|---|---|
| solid, SSS | Opaque (default) |
| cut-out (leaves, fences) | Masked, and wire `Material.OpacityMask` |
| colored glass, tinted liquid | `TranslucentColoredTransmittance`, coverage via `SubstrateWeight` |
| grey-tinted transparency, cheaper | Translucent |
| glow only | Additive |

`TranslucentColoredTransmittance` is accepted only when Substrate is on.

## Cost

Each operator that is not parameter-blended adds a closure, which is roughly a whole extra
lighting pass per pixel. For game assets keep one closure: set
`bUseParameterBlending: true` on Horizontal / Vertical / Add operators. The look becomes a
blend of parameters instead of two layers of light, and it usually holds up. Keep true
multi-layer results for hero assets and film. Anisotropy, glints, specular profiles,
Fuzz, SSS diffusion and F90 each push the Slab into a more expensive class. Details and
the out-of-budget behavior: **`references/pitfalls.md`**.

## Failure handling

- **The compile result is in `material_apply_graph`'s reply.** Match the error text
  against the table in **`references/pitfalls.md`**: each line there names its fix.
- **A Substrate node is refused with "not enabled"** means you skipped step 1. Go back
  to it.
- **"is ignored for this material"** when connecting means you wired a classic pin while
  `FrontMaterial` is in use. Move that input onto the Slab (BaseColor maps to
  `Diffuse Albedo`, Roughness to `Roughness`, Normal to `Normal`, Emissive to
  `Emissive Color`, Metallic via `SubstrateMetalnessToDiffuseAlbedoF0`).
- **A property is refused** with "no field ...": the reply lists the settable names.
  Use one of those.
- **It compiles but looks wrong.** Check the blend mode against the table above, then
  whether the SSS or coverage rules apply, before changing values.

## Escalation

These are not reachable through the tools. Say so and hand them to the user:

- Creating Subsurface Profile or Specular Profile assets. The tools can point a Slab at
  an existing one through `properties`.
- The editor's one-way "Convert To Substrate" on an existing classic material. Rebuilding
  the graph with Slabs through `material_apply_graph` is the tool-side alternative.
- Material layer stacks (`r.Substrate.EnableLayerSupport`, experimental).
- Per-platform budget cvars such as `r.Substrate.BytesPerPixel` or closures per pixel.
  Changing them affects the whole project's performance, so the user decides.
